Air Quality Prediction Model
Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various pollutants, which is crucial for public health and environmental management. The main pollutants influencing air quality in India include PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, NOx), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to accurately forecast AQI values using machine learning algorithms. These predictions aim to assist decision-makers in issuing health advisories, formulating environmental policies, and enabling the public to plan activities accordingly.

Data Exploration
The dataset consists of 29,531 entries and 14 columns, including various pollutants and AQI values. A significant number of missing values were detected, particularly in the pollutant measurements. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, detecting outliers, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships among the variables.

Modeling Approach
Data Preparation: The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with the pollutants as input features and AQI as the target variable.
Algorithms Used: Several regression algorithms were applied, including:
Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Each model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared values.

Results
The results indicate the modelâ€™s capability to predict AQI values effectively, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements. Accurate AQI forecasting can significantly contribute to public health initiatives, environmental sustainability, and informed policy-making.

Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of machine learning in environmental science, particularly in predicting air quality. By leveraging data-driven insights, we can tackle air pollution challenges more effectively, promoting healthier communities and sustainable practices.
